<h1>The Best Movies According to Dada</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time </h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Superman</h3>
<p>The first time we see Superman in his red, blue and yellow uniform is nearly an hour into “Superman.” Perhaps the filmmakers agreed with Spielberg’s famous statement that “Jaws” would work better the longer he kept the shark off the screen. That means the film doesn’t open like most superhero movies or James Bonds with a sensational pre-title sequence. To be sure, it opens on the planet Krypton with his father Jor-El preparing him to be launched into space. But those aren’t action scenes; they provide weight to the origin story every superhero requires.</p>

<h3>The Crow</h3>
<p>Good movies always have integrity, but not-good movies can have integrity, too. “The Crow,” about a man who is murdered along with the love of his life and comes back from the dead to avenge her, is an vivid example of this principle. It has a lot of elements that don’t work (including a symbolism-laden recurring flashback to a childhood trauma that landed the hero, Eric Draven, in a mental institution) and you sort of just have to accept that the central love story is powerful because the film needs it to be, and because the actors are likable. Zach Baylin and William Schneider’s script takes a while setting up the horrifying central event that drives the rest of the story, and the movie doesn’t get to the point where the hero becomes The Crow, a self-painted, faintly Joker-esque angel of death, until the final stretch. And there are a lot of other problems/issues that I’ll get to in due course.</p>

<h3>The People's Joker</h3>
<p>Before you see a single frame of Vera Drew’s Batman-soaked satire “The People’s Joker,” you’re greeted with an enormous wall-of-text disclaimer: “This film is a parody and is at present time completely unauthorized by DC Comics, Warner Bros. Discovery, or anyone else claiming ownership of the characters and subjects that it parodies and references,” etc. Then, a smaller, more personal dedication: “To Mom, and Joel Schumacher.” </p>
